<p><em>All you need to work through this book is a computer with a web browser (preferably Firefox 2 or
higher, Safari 2 or higher, or Internet Explorer 6 or higher), and a simple text editor such as Notepad on
Windows or TextEdit on Mac</em>. </p>

<p> If you have a web - page editor program, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver or Microsoft FrontPage, you
are welcome to use it. I will not be teaching you how to use these programs; rather, I will be teaching
you how to write by hand the code that these programs produce. Even if you use one of these tools,
when you understand the code it generates you can then go in and edit it, which means you have much
greater control over how your sites look and the ability to make them more attractive</p>
<p>The first six chapters of the book describe the different elements and attributes that make up HTML and
XHTML and how you can use them to write web pages. These chapters are organized into task - related areas,
such as structuring a document into headings and paragraphs; creating links between pages; adding images,

audio and video; and displaying tables. With each task or topic that is introduced, you will see an example
first to give you an idea of what is possible; then you can look at the elements and attributes used in detail.</p>
<p>The first chapter of this book will show you that the main task in creating a web site is marking up the text you
want to appear on your site, using elements and attributes . As you will see, these elements and attributes
describe the structure of a document (what is a heading, what is a paragraph of text, what is a link, and so on).
